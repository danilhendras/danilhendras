## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

My personal portfolio site. Though it's still quite a while before I can consider it finished, the preview is live already at [danilhendra.netlify.app](https://danilhendra.netlify.app). It's still in active development, so pardon me if you saw a bug when you click the link ðŸ˜‰.

To be specific, right now I'm working on integrating Netlify CMS to the site for easier content management. 

Built using [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) & [GSAP](https://greensock.com)

I love cats, not the angry ones tho.
