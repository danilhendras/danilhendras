# Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Danil Hendra Suryawan
I'm a 2nd-year CS major at [University of National Development, East Java](https://upnjatim.ac.id). I'm all about JavaScript, currently meddling around frontend frameworks (Vue and React in particular). I'm actively contributing to [nuxtjs.org](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxtjs.org) as a translator. As for projects, I'm currently busy with an [event registration website](https://github.com/pps-ti/web-pendaftaran-seed) for my department's software engineering education team.
