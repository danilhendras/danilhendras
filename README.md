# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Danil Hendra
I'm a 2nd-year CS student at [University of National Development, East Java](https://upnjatim.ac.id). I'm all about JavaScript and currently meddling around frontend frameworks, particularly Vue and React. I'm actively contributing to [nuxtjs.org](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxtjs.org) as a translator. As for projects, I'm currently busy with an event registration website for my campus' software engineering education team.
